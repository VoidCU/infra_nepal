          Why Hydropower Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
          Nepal possesses an enormous hydropower potential, estimated at over 83,000 MW. Yet only a small fraction of this potential has been harnessed so far. By investing in state-of-the-art hydropower projects, we aim to not only generate sustainable energy but also drive socio-economic growth by creating jobs, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and modernizing the power grid.
